**Notes:**

- **Security Strengths:** The security strength of an algorithm is measured in bits and represents the estimated computational effort required to break the algorithm. The table lists the security strength in bits as described in SP 800-57.
- **Legacy Algorithms:** Legacy algorithms are those that are no longer approved for new applications but are allowed for processing already protected information (e.g., decryption or signature verification).
- **Deprecated Algorithms:** Deprecated algorithms are those that are still allowed for a limited time but should be replaced by stronger alternatives as soon as possible.
- **Disallowed Algorithms:** Disallowed algorithms are those that are no longer approved for any use.
- **Key Sizes**: The key lengths specified are minimums for FIPS compliance. Implementations should use the largest approved key size appropriate for the required security strength and application.
- **Transition Dates:** Some algorithms have specific transition dates. After these dates, the use of those algorithms may be restricted or disallowed.
- **SP 800-131A:** SP 800-131A provides guidance on transitioning to stronger cryptographic keys and algorithms, and it defines the terms "acceptable", "deprecated", "legacy use", and "disallowed" for cryptographic algorithms.
- **Self-Tests:** Cryptographic modules must perform self-tests on all implemented cryptographic algorithms before the first operational use. These tests are called Cryptographic Algorithm Self-Tests (CASTs). The algorithms must be tested using the smallest approved key length or modulus size.
- **Component Validation List (CVL):** The CAVP and CMVP have identified several components of approved algorithms that can be used in an approved mode of operation. These components are listed as "CVL" in the CMVP documentation.
- **Vendor Affirmation:** For some algorithms, if CAVP testing is not available, vendor affirmation may be allowed. In this case, the vendor must provide clear documentation and reasoning as to why the algorithm can be used in the approved mode and must meet the requirements set out in the relevant IGs.
- **Non-Approved Security Functions:** Non-approved security functions, such as non-approved algorithms, may be used in an approved mode of operation if certain requirements are met. They should not be used to meet the requirements of FIPS 140-3 sections 6 and 7. Non-approved algorithms are not to access or share CSPs in a way that counters the requirements.
- **FIPS 186-5:** FIPS 186-5 specifies the approved elliptic curves for ECDSA.

**Additional Notes:**

- **FIPS 140-2 vs FIPS 140-3:** FIPS 140-2 is still valid, but as of March 31, 2022, cryptographic modules are no longer tested for FIPS 140-2 certifications. FIPS 140-3 is the current standard and incorporates ISO/IEC 19790:2012 and ISO/IEC 24759:2017.
- **CMVP:** The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) is a joint effort between NIST and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) that validates cryptographic modules.
- **Key Derivation:** Key derivation functions (KDFs) are used to generate keys from a secret value. Approved KDFs are listed in SP 800-135 and SP 800-56C.
- **Key Agreement:** Key agreement schemes, like Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV), are used to establish shared secrets between two parties.
- **Digital Signatures:** Digital signatures, such as RSA, DSA, and ECDSA, provide authentication and non-repudiation.
- **Hash Functions**: Hash functions like SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 are used to create message digests or checksums of data. SHA-1 is disallowed for digital signature generation.
- **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)**: MACs like HMAC, CMAC, and GMAC provide integrity and authenticity.
